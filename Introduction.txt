					Project by Chitturi Sai Suman and Praneeth Kapila


		PLAGIARISM:

			Plagiarism is defined as the practice of directly copying and then presenting an existing
		production without accurate citing or referencing, and/or passing off the product as oneâ€™s own,
		without permission from the original producer.

			Plagiarism is the most frequent offence under the Academic Code of Conduct, as a result of
		a lack of proper acknowledgement. By understanding the plagiarism meaning and being able to identify
		the plagiarism definition, you can be confident that you will avoid the consequences.


		INSPIRATION:

			Plagiarism became a serious issue now a days due to the presence of vast resources easily
		available on the web, which makes developing plagiarism detection tool a useful and challengnig
		task due to the scalability issues.

			Our project is implementing a Plagiarism Detection Engine oriented for Programming Source codes.
		A set of Programming source codes are tested for Plagiarism check and hence reported whether or not the
		the pair of codes are Plagiarised.
